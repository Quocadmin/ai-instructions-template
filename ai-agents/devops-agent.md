```

### **Infrastructure Standards**
```yaml
# Example CI/CD pipeline configuration
name: 'Deployment Pipeline'

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run tests
        run: [YOUR_TEST_COMMAND]

  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Security scan
        run: [YOUR_SECURITY_SCAN_COMMAND]

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [test, security-scan]
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: [YOUR_DEPLOY_COMMAND]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è DevOps Technical Patterns

### **Container Pattern**
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage Dockerfile example
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

FROM node:18-alpine AS production
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
USER node
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### **Infrastructure as Code Pattern**
```hcl
# Terraform example
resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "${var.project_name}-server"
    Environment = var.environment
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "app_sg" {
  name_prefix = "${var.project_name}-sg"
  
  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

### **Monitoring Pattern**
```yaml
# Basic monitoring configuration
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: [YOUR_APP_IMAGE]
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3

  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

# macOS/Linux
cd /path/to/[PROJECT_ROOT] && [YOUR_INFRA_COMMANDS]

# WSL2 (Recommended for Windows)
cd /mnt/c/Projects/[PROJECT_ROOT] && [YOUR_INFRA_COMMANDS]
```

### **Environment Management**
```yaml
# Multi-environment configuration
environments:
  development:
    replicas: 1
    resources:
      cpu: "0.5"
      memory: "512Mi"
  
  staging:
    replicas: 2
    resources:
      cpu: "1"
      memory: "1Gi"
  
  production:
    replicas: 3
    resources:
      cpu: "2"
      memory: "2Gi"
```

## üÜò DevOps Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**
1. **Deployment Failures**: Check container logs and resource limits
2. **Network Issues**: Verify security groups and load balancer configuration
3. **Performance Problems**: Monitor resource usage and scaling policies
4. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Scan images and update dependencies

### **Debugging Strategies**
- Use centralized logging for troubleshooting
- Implement health checks and monitoring
- Set up alerting for critical issues
- Maintain runbooks for common problems

## üéì DevOps Learning & Improvement

### **Areas for Growth**
- **Infrastructure Optimization**: Cost management and performance tuning
