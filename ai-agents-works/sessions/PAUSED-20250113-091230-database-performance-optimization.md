# AI Work Session - Database Performance Optimization

**Session Status**: PAUSED  
**Started**: 2025-01-13 09:12:30  
**Paused**: 2025-01-13 11:45:15  
**Duration So Far**: 2h 32m 45s  
**Agent**: database-agent  
**Objective**: Optimize PostgreSQL query performance and implement caching strategy  
**Priority**: High  
**Pause Reason**: Waiting for production database metrics and DBA consultation  

## Session Overview

Working on comprehensive database performance optimization for the ADX Core system. Initial analysis revealed several slow queries and missing indexes that are impacting user experience. Session paused to gather production metrics and consult with senior DBA before proceeding with index changes.

## Progress So Far

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
- [09:12] Analyzed slow query logs from past 7 days
- [09:30] Identified top 10 problematic queries
- [09:45] Performed EXPLAIN ANALYZE on critical queries
- [10:15] Documented current index strategy
- [10:30] Benchmarked current query performance
- [10:45] Researched PostgreSQL optimization best practices
- [11:00] Created test database with production-like data
- [11:15] Drafted index optimization plan
- [11:30] Prepared Redis caching strategy proposal

### üîÑ In Progress (When Paused)
- Performance testing with proposed indexes
- Cache invalidation strategy design
- Query rewrite for complex joins

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Blocked/Waiting For
- **Production Metrics**: Need detailed I/O and connection pool stats
- **DBA Review**: Senior DBA consultation scheduled for 14:00 today
- **Stakeholder Approval**: Index changes require production deployment approval
- **Load Testing Environment**: Staging environment being prepared with production data volume

## Technical Analysis

### Performance Issues Identified

1. **Slow Query Hotspots**
   ```sql
   -- Query taking 2.3s average (should be <100ms)
   SELECT u.*, p.*, r.role_name 
   FROM users u 
   LEFT JOIN profiles p ON u.id = p.user_id 
   LEFT JOIN roles r ON u.role_id = r.id 
   WHERE u.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
   ORDER BY u.last_login DESC 
   LIMIT 50;
   ```
   - **Issue**: Missing composite index on (created_at, last_login)
   - **Impact**: User dashboard loads slowly

2. **Missing Indexes**
   - `profiles.user_id` - causing slow JOINs
   - `audit_logs.timestamp` - affecting reporting queries
   - `sessions.expires_at` - impacting cleanup jobs

3. **Inefficient Queries**
   - N+1 query patterns in user activity feeds
   - Unnecessary DISTINCT clauses
   - Suboptimal JOIN order

### Proposed Solutions

#### Index Strategy
```sql
-- High Impact Indexes (Ready to implement)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_created_login 
ON users (created_at, last_login DESC);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_profiles_user_id 
ON profiles (user_id);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_audit_logs_timestamp 
ON audit_logs (timestamp DESC);

-- Medium Impact Indexes (Needs testing)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_sessions_expires_user 
ON sessions (expires_at, user_id) 
WHERE expires_at > NOW();
```

#### Caching Strategy
- **Redis Implementation**: Cache frequently accessed user profiles
- **Query Result Caching**: Cache expensive aggregation queries for 5 minutes
- **Session Data**: Move session storage from PostgreSQL to Redis

## Metrics and Benchmarks

### Current Performance Baseline
- **Average Query Time**: 245ms
- **95th Percentile**: 1.2s
- **99th Percentile**: 3.1s
- **Slow Queries (>1s)**: 23% of total queries
- **Database Connections**: 45/100 pool utilization
- **Index Hit Ratio**: 94.2% (target: >95%)

### Target Performance Goals
- **Average Query Time**: <100ms
- **95th Percentile**: <500ms
- **99th Percentile**: <1s
- **Slow Queries**: <5% of total queries
- **Index Hit Ratio**: >98%

## Next Steps (After Resuming)

### Priority 1 (Immediate)
1. Review production metrics with DBA
2. Validate index strategy against real traffic patterns
3. Test proposed indexes on staging environment
4. Measure performance impact of each index

### Priority 2 (This Week)
1. Implement Redis caching layer
2. Optimize identified slow queries
3. Set up monitoring for query performance
4. Create database maintenance procedures

### Priority 3 (Future)
1. Implement query result caching
2. Consider read replicas for reporting
3. Evaluate connection pooling optimization
4. Plan for database partitioning if needed

## Pause Context

### Why Paused
- **Production Safety**: Need DBA approval for index changes on live system
- **Data Requirements**: Missing detailed production metrics for informed decisions
- **Resource Availability**: Senior DBA consultation scheduled for this afternoon

### Resume Conditions
- ‚úÖ Production metrics analysis completed
- ‚úÖ DBA consultation finished with recommendations
- ‚úÖ Staging environment ready with production data volume
- ‚úÖ Stakeholder approval for production index deployment

### Environment State
- Test database running with sample optimizations
- Benchmarking scripts prepared and tested
- Documentation drafted for all proposed changes
- Rollback procedures documented

## Knowledge Captured

### Insights Gained
- **PostgreSQL EXPLAIN Analysis**: Query planner choosing suboptimal paths due to outdated statistics
- **Index Impact**: Composite indexes significantly more effective than single-column for our query patterns
- **Connection Pooling**: Current pool size adequate but need better connection lifecycle management

### Tools and Techniques Used
- `pg_stat_statements` for query analysis
- `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` for detailed query plans
- `pgbench` for load testing
- Custom benchmark scripts for real-world query patterns

### References
- PostgreSQL Performance Tuning Guide (official docs)
- "High Performance PostgreSQL" optimization patterns
- ADX Core database architecture documentation
